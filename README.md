🧠 DAO-ML Solidity Generated Smart Contract Testing

This repository includes the smart contracts, tests, and results of the gas consumption analysis concerning the smart contracts generated by means of the DAO-ML to Solidity Editor. The Travelware case study is used for the evaluation of the artifacts.

📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how DAO organizational models specified using the DAO-ML modeling language can be automatically translated into Solidity smart contracts using an optimized, model-driven approach. The project includes:

    Generated smart contracts representing various DAO governance roles and committees.

    A simulation DAO to validate permission assignment and role revocation and assingment in the context of a DAO with few roles (3)and permission (6) assignments. 

    🔍 Gas reporting is enabled via hardhat-gas-reporter, and supports reproducible benchmarking of DAO operations. The gas-report.txt file includes data concerning the gas consumption. 
📊 Gas Consumption Benchmarking

As described in Section 7.2.2 of the technical report, we benchmarked gas usage of DAO-ML-generated contracts by comparing:

    Travelhive DAO (complex organizational structure)

    Simulated DAO (simplified structure with fewer permissions)

The analysis demonstrates how DAO-ML supports scalable smart contract deployment while preserving transparency and access control guarantees.
