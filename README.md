# DAO-ML Solidity Generated Smart Contract Testing

This repository includes the smart contracts, tests, and results of the gas consumption analysis concerning the smart contracts generated by means of the DAO-ML to Solidity Editor. The Travelware case study is used for the evaluation of the artifacts.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how DAO organizational models specified using the DAO-ML modeling language can be automatically translated into Solidity smart contracts using an optimized, model-driven approach. The project includes:

    Generated smart contracts representing various DAO governance roles and committees that meet the specififcations of the Travelware case study, concerning a destination management system based on DAOs.

    A simulation DAO to validate permission assignment and role revocation and assingment in the context of a DAO with few roles (3)and permission (6) assignments. 

    üîç Gas reporting is enabled via hardhat-gas-reporter, and supports reproducible benchmarking of DAO operations. The gas-report.txt file includes data concerning the gas consumption. 
    
The analysis demonstrates how DAO-ML supports scalable smart contract deployment while preserving transparency and access control guarantees.
