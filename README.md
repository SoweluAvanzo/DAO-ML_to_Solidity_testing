# DAO-ML Solidity Generated Smart Contract Testing

This repository includes the smart contracts, tests, and results of the gas consumption analysis concerning the smart contracts generated by means of the DAO-ML to Solidity Editor. The Travelware case study is used for the evaluation of the artifacts.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how DAO organizational models specified using the DAO-ML modeling language can be automatically translated into Solidity smart contracts using an optimized, model-driven approach. The project includes:

- Generated smart contracts representing various DAO governance roles and committees that meet the specifications of the Travelware case study, concerning a destination management system based on two DAOs. 

- A simulation DAO to validate permission assignment and role revocation and assignment in the context of a DAO with few roles (3) and permission (6) assignments. 

- The gas consumption analysis compares the contracts generated using DAO-ML with the Aragon PermissionManager contracts, for which we refer the reader to the repository at this [link](https://github.com/SoweluAvanzo/Aragon-PermissionManager-gas-cost-analysis).

üîç Gas reporting for the DAO-ML smart contracts is conducted via **hardhat-gas-reporter**. The **Gas Consumption Analysis Results** folder includes data concerning the gas consumption analysis of both the DAO-ML DAOs tested (`gas-report_DAO_ML.txt`) and the Aragon PermissionManager contracts (`average-gas-used-by-description_Aragon.xlsx`) for users to compare the two approaches.

The analysis demonstrates how DAO-ML supports scalable smart contract deployment while preserving transparency and access control guarantees.
